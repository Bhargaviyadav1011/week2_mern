        <h2>Introduction to Photography</h2>
        <p>Photography is more than just pointing a camera and pressing a button. It's an art form that allows us to capture moments, tell stories, and express emotions. Whether you're using a smartphone or a professional DSLR, the principles of good photography remain the same. This article will guide you through some fundamental concepts to help you start your photographic journey.</p>

        <h3>Understanding Your Camera</h3>
        <p>Before you can take stunning photos, it's essential to understand the basic functions of your camera. While every camera is different, common controls include:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Shutter Speed:</strong> Controls how long the camera's shutter stays open. Faster speeds freeze motion, slower speeds create motion blur.</li>
            <li><strong>Aperture:</strong> Controls the size of the lens opening. A wider aperture (smaller f-number) creates a shallow depth of field (blurry background), while a narrower aperture (larger f-number) keeps more of the scene in focus.</li>
            <li><strong>ISO:</strong> Determines the camera's sensitivity to light. Higher ISO values are useful in low light but can introduce noise (grain) into your images.</li>
            <li><strong>White Balance:</strong> Adjusts the color temperature of your image to make whites appear neutral under different lighting conditions.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Composition: The Key to Engaging Photos</h3>
        <p>Composition refers to the arrangement of elements within your frame. Good composition can transform a mundane photo into a masterpiece. Here are a few basic rules:</p>
        <ol>
            <li><strong>Rule of Thirds:</strong> Imagine your image divided into nine equal sections by two horizontal and two vertical lines. Place your main subject along these lines or at their intersections for a more balanced and engaging shot.</li>
            <li><strong>Leading Lines:</strong> Use natural or artificial lines in your scene to draw the viewer's eye towards your subject.</li>
            <li><strong>Framing:</strong> Use elements in your environment (like doorways, windows, or branches) to create a natural frame around your subject.</li>
            <li><strong>Symmetry and Patterns:</strong> Look for repeating patterns or symmetrical elements to create visually appealing images.</li>
            <li><strong>Negative Space:</strong> Don't be afraid to leave empty space around your subject. This can help the subject stand out and create a sense of simplicity.</li>
        </ol>

        <h3>Lighting: Your Best Friend</h3>
        <p>Light is arguably the most crucial element in photography. Understanding how light interacts with your subject can dramatically improve your photos.</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Natural Light:</strong> The sun is your most abundant light source. "Golden hour" (shortly after sunrise and before sunset) offers soft, warm light perfect for portraits and landscapes.</li>
            <li><strong>Artificial Light:</strong> Flash units, studio lights, and even household lamps can be used to illuminate your subjects. Learn to control their direction and intensity.</li>
            <li><strong>Direction of Light:</strong> Front-lighting can flatten subjects, side-lighting adds dimension and texture, and back-lighting creates dramatic silhouettes.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Practice Makes Perfect</h3>
        <p>The best way to become a better photographer is to practice regularly. Experiment with different settings, compositions, and lighting conditions. Don't be afraid to make mistakes; they are part of the learning process. Share your work, get feedback, and continuously strive to improve.</p>
